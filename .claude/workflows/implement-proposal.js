// Spec always comes first: the staged spec amendments are applied and
// verified before any code. With implementCode false the run stops after
// the spec is landed and committed. The code phase is the
// implement-proposal-build subworkflow (blast radius + ordered build
// sequence + step-by-step implementation with tests).
//
// The spec is the source of truth and the proposal is the unit of work. The
// §6.7.1 capability matrix, the harness adapters, and the rest of the
// surface are kept consistent by `make coverage-gate` (lint, speccov-drift,
// matrix-audit, doccov-check, coverage-budget), which the build subworkflow
// runs.
//
// Preconditions (the skill checks them before invoking): the proposal
// Status is "Approved" (or already "Applied to spec" for a re-run), and
// spec/ is clean in git so the apply verification can diff against a clean
// baseline.
//
// MAINTENANCE: the implement-proposal skill documents this workflow and its
// subworkflow; keep them in sync.

  "- The spec cross-references other spec content by section number only: §X.Y or a relative markdown link to a section anchor. Replace a line-number cross-reference in staged text with the containing section's number.\n" +
  "- Line numbers in the proposal's ANCHOR INSTRUCTIONS are location hints for you and never become spec content. Locate anchors by the quoted text and section headings; line numbers drift.\n" +
  "- A staged edit that introduces a brand-new section or subsection is appended at the end of its level, after the last existing sibling at that level, and numbered as the next ordinal. Never insert a new section or subsection between existing ones: inserting in the middle forces every following section to be renumbered and breaks existing cross-references. When a staged anchor instruction would place a new section or subsection between existing ones, append it at the end of that level instead, renumber it to the next ordinal, and record the deviation. Editing the body of an existing section in place is unaffected by this rule; it applies only to introducing a new numbered section or subsection.\n" +
