  '  **What changes.** Three to six bullets, one per top-level change, each naming the surface it lands on.\n' +
  '  **Fixed decisions.** The decisions an implementor must not revisit, one line each. This is distinct from the Decisions section, which says why a decision was taken; this says which are closed.\n' +
  '  **Watch out for.** The traps: a surface that looks safe to change and is not, an ordering that matters, a test that will mislead, a prior attempt that failed and why.\n';

  "- [ ] **S1 · spec** — SPEC-1. One line saying what lands.\n" +
  "      Levels: unit, e2e. Depends on: —\n" +

  "  Name the staged deliverables by their ids (SPEC-1, CODE-2, DOCS-1, TEST-1). Every staged deliverable appears in exactly one step, and no step names one that does not exist.\n" +
  "  Prefer one deliverable per step. Bundle two only when separating them gains nothing, which means they touch the same file and the same reader would review them together.\n" +
  "  The lane after the step id is spec, code, test, or docs. Spec steps come first and code steps follow, which is the order the implementation pipeline applies them and the order to prefer. Interleaving a code step before a remaining spec step is allowed where it is genuinely more efficient, and a step that does so states why on its line, so an interleave is a deliberate and reviewable act rather than an accident.\n" +
  '  "Levels" lists the test levels that step must run, per .claude/rules/test-coverage.md: unit, integration, e2e, materialization, conformance. "Depends on" lists earlier step ids, or an em dash when the step has none.\n' +

  "The constraint is not optional. Without it the marker is a licence rather than a delegation, and the implementor has nothing to satisfy or to be checked against.\n" +
  "A blank is allowed only where the choice is local, reversible, and has no consequence in another section. A blank is NEVER allowed for an HTTP or meta-tool contract, a manifest field name, an error code, a security or fail-closed predicate, which component performs an action, an ordering that another step depends on, a name that appears in more than one place, or anything a test must assert.

Editing a generated artifact instead of its authoring source, or changing a §6.7.1 capability cell in the spec without the pkg/adapter/capability.go mirror (or vice versa), counts.\n" +
  "(e) A described mechanism cannot work: race conditions, bypassable mandatory gates, unreachable states, wrong defaults, mismatched granularity, predicate drift between sections, config-merge or inject non-idempotency, or ordering problems.\n" +

Three things about a blank ARE findings, and you should report them. A marker with no constraint, because that delegates without bounding. A blank over something the format bars from delegation, which is a wire contract or field name, a security or fail-closed predicate, which component performs an action, an ordering another step depends on, a name appearing in more than one place, or anything a test must assert. And a gap that is left unmarked, which is the ordinary underspecified-target finding and is unaffected by this rule.\n\n" +

This loop retires a lens once it returns nothing, so your lens may not run again before the proposal is certified: a finding you hold back is not caught by a later pass of your own lens, and it costs an entire extra round for every other reviewer. Before returning, walk the proposal section by section and ask, for each section, whether your lens has anything on it; do not stop at the first finding or at the most severe one, and do not withhold a substantiated finding because the proposal reads as polished elsewhere or because you have already reported several.

A change that silently removes, bypasses, or feature-gates a mandatory control, or makes a security path fail open, is a finding. (2) Trust boundary of a security-bounding value — for every value that bounds a security property (an org/tenant selection, a visibility decision, a verified claim), confirm the authoritative source is a trusted component and not a caller-supplied or unverified input. The §6.3.3 analysis is the bar: an `oidc-jwt` `org_id` is trusted because the token is cryptographically verified, whereas a `trusted-headers` `X-Podium-User-Org` is trusted only because the gateway is assumed to have set it, which is why that mode constrains the bind and requires a proxy secret in multi-tenant mode. A new security-bounding value sourced from an unverified caller input, with no equivalent control, is a finding. Durability is part of the same check: a bound that can silently RESET or RELAX when its store is unavailable, because it has no durable fallback, is a finding even when its source is trusted.

A change that updates one harness's surface while leaving a parallel representation inconsistent, omits a capability cell for an added type/field/mode/event/harness, contradicts a harness's documented native layout or config schema, or silently breaks the core feature set is a finding; name the harness, the surface, and the concrete consequence.",

The docs surfaces are the guide pages (docs/getting-started, docs/authoring, docs/consuming/<harness>.md, docs/deployment), the reference pages (docs/reference), and the runnable examples that tools/doccov/manifest.yaml maps to e2e tests (a new or changed runnable example needs its manifest entry and its doc-e2e test). A docs/ page left describing superseded behavior, an added runnable example missing its doccov mapping, or a staged docs edit that contradicts the post-change spec, is a finding. Two hard guardrails: (1) never raise a finding that asks the spec or the implementation to change to match an existing doc; when a doc and the spec disagree the doc is the defect and is reconciled toward the spec, so a finding here is always a missing or wrong docs edit. (2) A doc-described scenario may be cited as a candidate test case only after that doc has been verified against the spec. This lens also owns two cases beyond mirroring a CHANGED behavior, because an accepted edge case is made of the two categories that do not register as a change. (a) An edge case or failure mode the proposal ACCEPTS OR DEFERS whose observable outcome is stated only in the proposal's reasoning and appears in neither the staged spec text nor the docs/ page that owns it; deferring the MECHANISM to a later proposal does not defer documenting the accepted behavior in the text that lands now. (b) A new operator-facing failure mode, or a new CAUSE of an existing failure or data-loss path, absent from the narrative operator documentation that enumerates that failure's causes (docs/deployment/operator-guide.md, and the troubleshooting section of the affected page). That is distinct from the companion-row check edit-sites owns, such as an error code's §6.10 entry or a runnable example's doccov manifest row: this is the failure narrative itself, which lists why the failure happens and must gain the new cause so an operator can recognize it.

Simulate applying the proposal end to end, in the order it states, and report anything that would stop or corrupt that application. Do not evaluate whether a change is correct or worthwhile; evaluate only whether it can be carried out as written.\n\nWork through the staged changes in their stated order and maintain a running model of the tree: which files exist, which headings and anchors exist, which identifiers are defined. For each staged edit, ask whether an implementor with only this proposal and the current tree could apply it without inventing anything. Findings are:\n" +
      "(1) FORWARD REFERENCE. An edit references an artifact that a LATER sub-step of the same proposal creates: a file that does not exist yet, a heading, anchor, section number, identifier, register, rule file, or test that a later sub-step introduces. Applying the proposal in its stated order would fail at this edit. Name the referencing sub-step, the referenced artifact, and the sub-step that creates it.\n" +
      "(2) UNDERSPECIFIED TARGET. An edit's content cannot be written deterministically because the proposal never states something that edit requires.\n" +
      "    Do not hunt for this by reading for suspicious passages. This defect is invisible at the referring site: the staged row, link, or index entry looks complete, and what is missing lives elsewhere in the document or nowhere at all. Build the worklist first, then check every member.\n" +
      "    Step 1, enumerate what the proposal CREATES or RENAMES: files, headings and subsections, identifiers (types, functions, fields, constants, error codes, env vars, CLI flags, meta-tools), registers and schemas, gates and tests, and directories. Include artifacts created by any sub-step, in any order. Take them from the staged changes, the target lists, and the files-touched section TOGETHER, because an artifact named in only one of those is the likeliest to be underspecified.\n" +
      "    Step 2, for each one, list the properties another edit, gate, or index needs in order to be written against it. A heading needs its exact title and the anchor that title derives to. A file needs its path. An identifier needs its exact spelling and every derived form (file stem, type name, constant, generated artifact, string literal). A register needs its key and entry schema. A gate or test needs its name and where it is registered.\n" +
      "    Step 3, for each property, find where the proposal states it. A property no sub-step states, one left to be 'authored from' surrounding content at application time, or one stated for only SOME members of a set the proposal otherwise treats uniformly, is a finding. Name the artifact, the property, the edit that needs it, and what an implementor would have to invent.\n" +
      "    Also count an anchor instruction that does not identify a unique location in the target file, and an edit that says to update a surface without stating the new value.\n" +
      "    A CORRECTED INSTANCE DOES NOT CLOSE THIS CLASS. When the proposal states these properties for one set of created artifacts (a heading table covering one file, say), that is evidence the class is LIVE and that every other created artifact must be held to the same standard. It is not evidence that the class is handled. Run steps 1 through 3 over every member regardless of how thoroughly a neighbouring case was specified.\n" +
      "(3) RELOCATION THAT LOSES CONTENT. For every edit described as a move, relocation, carve-out, reduction, or supersession, verify BOTH legs are staged: the source's removal AND the destination's full replacement text. A reduction that deletes a table, tool list, schema, or rule set whose text appears nowhere in the destination staging is content loss rather than relocation, and it is a finding even when the proposal calls it a move. Also check that the destination text carries every element the source held, and that anything still pointing at the source is redirected.\n" +
      "(4) ORDERING AND GATE STATE. An edit whose sub-step ordering contradicts its dependencies, a step that leaves the tree in a state where an EXISTING gate hard-fails with no recorded disposition (a schema breaking-change check against a baseline ref, a lint, a no-drift test, a citation ratchet, a coverage floor), or a proposal that adds a gate which its own staged text would fail. State the gate, the command or test that runs it, and why it fails.\n" +
      "(5) UNRESOLVABLE ANCHOR. An anchor instruction quoting surrounding text that does not match the current file, or that matches in more than one place so the edit site is ambiguous.\n\n" +
      "(6) EXECUTION-MODEL INVERSION. The pipeline that applies this proposal lands its spec/ edits FIRST, verifies them, and commits them as their own commit, before any code is written (.claude/skills/implement-proposal/SKILL.md states this as a hard constraint). A proposal whose spec edits depend on code that the same proposal builds therefore cannot be applied at all, in any order: at spec-apply time the code does not exist, and the pipeline will not build it first. Check for this explicitly, because it is invisible when you simulate the proposal's own stated order, where the dependency is satisfied.\n" +
      "    The test: does applying any staged spec edit require running, reading, or consulting something this proposal builds under cmd/, pkg/, internal/, tools/, or test/? A migration script that performs the rewrite, a register or map that resolves each site's replacement, a generated artifact, a lint whose output selects the edit sites. If so, the spec edits will be hand-applied by an agent with none of it available. Report it, naming the spec sub-step, the code artifact it depends on, and the sub-step that builds that artifact.\n" +
      "    Two signals make it near-certain and are worth grepping for: the proposal says it enumerates no edit sites, or states that completeness is proven by gates rather than by review, while still staging spec edits. Both mean the spec edits have no hand-appliable form by design.\n" +
      "    The resolution is a split (the code lands as its own proposal, first) or an explicit entry criterion, so state the gap and let the author choose. A proposal that already records such a prerequisite is conformant and is NOT a finding. Do not report ordinary sequencing inside one phase, which is class 4; this class is only the spec-before-code boundary the pipeline imposes from outside the document.\n\n" +
      "Method: read the proposal's staged-changes section in full and in order, then open the actual target files to confirm each anchor and each referenced artifact. Build the existence model as you go; a forward reference is only visible if you track what each sub-step creates. That model and class 2's step-1 worklist are the same enumeration read two ways, so build it once: for each created artifact ask both WHEN it exists relative to the edits that reference it (class 1) and WHETHER every property those edits need is stated (class 2). Do not report an edit as unappliable because you would have written it differently, and do not report ordinary implementation judgment (choosing a variable name, formatting a table) as underspecification. The test is whether a competent implementor would be forced to guess at something the proposal was responsible for stating." +
      "\n(CHECKLIST) THE IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST IS THE APPLICATION ORDER, so this lens owns it. Read it against the staged deliverables and report: a staged deliverable that appears in no step; a deliverable named by two steps; a step naming a deliverable the proposal does not stage; a Depends-on that names a later step or a step that does not exist; a step whose lane is code while a spec step it depends on comes after it, unless the step's line states why the interleave is deliberate; and a step whose level list omits a level its deliverable plainly reaches. Simulate the checklist as the order of application: if applying the steps in their stated order would hit a forward reference that applying them in another order would not, the checklist is the defect rather than the edit.\n" +

    "Lens: plan conformance. This proposal implements one or more steps of the plan at " +

    ". Your job is to find deliverables that plan assigns to the steps this proposal claims, which the proposal neither stages nor consciously declines. This is the one lens that reads a document outside the current tree, and the one blind spot no other lens covers: every other reviewer checks the proposal against the repository, so a deliverable the plan required and the proposal simply never mentions is invisible to all of them.\n\n" +
    "REPORT ABSENCE, NEVER INCOMPLETENESS. This is the rule that keeps the lens useful, and it follows from what makes it unique. A deliverable the proposal never mentions is invisible to every other reviewer, because there is nothing in the text for them to check against the repository. A deliverable the proposal DOES stage is the opposite case: the tree-facing lenses measure it against the actual code, schemas, docs, and tests, which is a better standard than a plan written earlier. So confine yourself to the first case. A finding is a deliverable the proposal stages NOTHING at all for. When the proposal stages the deliverable and it is thin, wrong, narrower than the plan describes, or missing a part, that is not yours: the lenses that read the repository own it. Ask whether the thing is missing, and never whether the thing is complete.\n\n" +
    "GRAIN. A deliverable is anything the plan requires to EXIST in the delivered system once the step lands, and that a reader could ask about on its own and get a yes-or-no answer. It covers prose and code alike: a document or a section of one; a file, package, or module; a named interface, type, function, method, endpoint, or message; a field or parameter the plan requires by name; a mechanism, code path, or behavior; a data artifact such as a schema, register, migration, or fixture; a gate, check, lint, or test suite; a tool or script; and a decision the plan requires to be recorded somewhere durable.\n\n" +
    "Two things are NOT deliverables, and they are where this lens goes wrong. First, a requirement about HOW THE WORK IS CARRIED OUT rather than about what exists once it is done: an exclusivity or freeze constraint, a sequencing or ordering rule, a dry run, a review step, or who performs the change. None of that is observable in the delivered system, so its absence cannot be stated as a defect in the repository, and a sequencing requirement whose absence would actually break the change belongs to the applicability lens instead. Second, the PHRASING of text that already exists and already carries the meaning the plan requires. Rewording is not a deliverable.\n\n" +
    "Method. First read the proposal to determine exactly which plan steps it claims to implement, and treat that claim as the scope boundary. Then read those steps in the plan, plus any plan-wide invariants, gates, or rules the plan states apply to every step, and enumerate the deliverables at the grain above. For each one, search the proposal for it. Search by the deliverable's own identifiers rather than by the plan's phrasing, because the proposal may name the same thing differently, and a deliverable found under another name is staged rather than missing.\n\n" +
    "A finding is a deliverable the plan assigns to a claimed step where the proposal does BOTH of the following: it stages nothing that produces the deliverable, and it records no decision to omit or defer it. Weight a deliverable the plan itself flags as having no other owner most heavily, since nothing else will supply it.\n\n" +
    "STATE THE CONSEQUENCE IN THE REPOSITORY. Every finding must say what will be absent or wrong in the repository after this proposal lands, in terms that do not mention the plan. The plan is where you found the gap; it is not the reason the gap matters. Also give the plan location that assigns the deliverable and the identifiers you searched the proposal for, so the gap is checkable. If you cannot state a consequence in the repository, the deliverable is below the grain above and you must not report it. This is a genuine filter rather than a formatting rule: a requirement about how the work is performed, and a difference in wording, both fail it, which is why neither is a finding.\n\n" +
    "ONE EXCEPTION to the absence rule, and only one: an IDENTITY MISMATCH on a staged deliverable. When the plan fixes an order, a numbering, a name, or a citable handle that its later steps or its own worked examples depend on, and the proposal fixes a different one without saying so, report it. This is not incompleteness. It is a conflict between two documents about what a thing is called, and no tree-facing lens can see it, because the plan is the other party to the conflict and those lenses do not read it. The consequence in the repository is concrete and satisfies the rule above: every citation written from either document resolves to the wrong target. Verify the plan's own worked examples still resolve against the proposal's version. Outside this one case, a staged deliverable is not yours.\n\n" +
    "HOW A FINDING IS RESOLVED, and the hard limits on this lens. Every finding you raise has exactly two acceptable resolutions, and both are edits to the proposal alone:\n" +
    "(a) the proposal stages the missing deliverable, or\n" +
    "(b) the proposal records an explicit, reasoned divergence from the plan for it.\n" +
    "You do not get to choose which. State the gap and let the author choose.\n\n" +
    "Four limits follow from that, and breaking any of them makes this lens a source of unresolvable findings:\n" +
    "1. A DIVERGENCE ALREADY RECORDED IS NOT A FINDING. When the proposal states that it departs from the plan on a point and gives a reason, that point is closed, EVEN IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE REASON. This lens checks that the decision was made and written down, and never that it was decided your way. A recorded divergence you find unpersuasive is a matter for the human reviewer, so do not re-file it as a conformance gap in any round, under any phrasing.\n" +
    "2. THE PLAN IS NOT AUTHORITATIVE OVER THE TREE. The spec and the code are the source of truth; the plan is an earlier design document and parts of it will be stale or wrong. When a plan instruction is contradicted by the current tree, or would introduce a defect another lens would rightly report, the gap is that the proposal has not RECORDED the divergence, and resolution (b) is the only correct one. Never raise a finding whose only resolution is to change the plan, and never ask the proposal to stage something the tree shows is wrong. Say plainly that the plan appears stale on the point and that the proposal should record why it departs.\n" +
    "3. STAY INSIDE THE CLAIMED STEPS. A deliverable the plan assigns to a step this proposal does not claim is out of scope and is not a finding, however important it looks. Deferred work belongs to the step that owns it.\n" +
    "4. HOLD THE GRAIN. A different but equivalent mechanism that delivers what the plan asked for is conformant, as is a different level of detail, a different internal ordering of the proposal, and different wording throughout. A count, a line budget, or a measured population stated in the plan's prose is a scale indicator rather than a deliverable, so a divergence in a number is not a finding unless a gate or a citation actually keys off it. When you are unsure whether something is a deliverable or a detail of one, apply the consequence test above: if you cannot say what will be absent or wrong in the repository, do not report it.\n\n" +
    "Before reporting, state in the coverage field: the plan steps the proposal claims, and the deliverables you enumerated for those steps at the grain above, each marked staged, consciously declined, or missing. This makes the scope you actually examined reviewable rather than implicit, and it is a check on yourself: a detail looks obviously out of place in a list of deliverables, so writing the list is how you catch a finding that has drifted below the grain before you report it.",
