//
// The sanitizer runs on the rendered output rather than on the markdown
// source, so a construct the renderer emits cannot bypass it and a construct
// the renderer passes through as markup is neutralized. No executable node
// and no event-handler attribute survives, and the allowlist admits no URL
// scheme other than http, https, and mailto on any attribute it keeps.
//
// Frontmatter does not reach this path. It is parsed into a property table
// whose values render as text.
