# How it works

Podium has two component categories:

- A **registry** — the system of record for artifacts.
- **Consumers** — the things that read from the registry. Three of
  them ship with Podium: language SDKs, an MCP server, and `podium
  sync`. You can write your own against the same HTTP API.

The registry can be reached two ways: as an HTTP service (single
binary or a multi-tenant deployment) or as a local filesystem path.
Most consumers work against the HTTP shape; `podium sync` is the
one consumer that also works against the filesystem shape directly.

---

## High-level architecture

Server-source shape — what most teams run once they're past the
filesystem stage:

```

                       │  Object storage          │

                       └─────────────▲────────────┘

       ┌─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┐

custom orchestrators       OpenCode, Pi, Hermes        harnesses
```

Filesystem-source shape — for solo work, prototypes, and CI:

```
   ~/podium-artifacts/             ┌─────────────┐
   ├── personal/                ──→│ podium sync │──→ harness directory
   │   └── greet/ARTIFACT.md       └─────────────┘    (.claude/, .cursor/, ...)
   ├── team-shared/                       ▲
   │   └── ...                            │
   └── .layer-order                       │
                              No daemon. No port. No auth.
                              The catalog is the directory.
```

Same artifacts, same `ARTIFACT.md` and `DOMAIN.md` formats, same
adapter behavior. The only thing that changes is whether `podium
sync` reaches the registry over HTTP or reads it directly from disk.

## What runs where

For server-source deployments:

| Component | Role | Where it runs |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Registry service | HTTP API; layer composition; visibility filtering; manifest indexing; hybrid retrieval; dependency graph; signing; audit | A server (single binary in standalone mode; replicated behind a load balancer in standard mode) |
| Postgres | Manifest metadata, layer config, admin grants, dependency edges, audit log, embeddings (when `pgvector` is the vector backend) | Alongside the registry (or managed RDS / Cloud SQL / Aurora) |
| Object storage | Bundled resource bytes, content-addressed | S3 / GCS / MinIO / R2 (filesystem in standalone mode) |
| Vector backend | Hybrid retrieval | `pgvector` and `sqlite-vec` collocate with the metadata store; managed alternatives include Pinecone, Weaviate Cloud, Qdrant Cloud |
| MCP server | In-process bridge for MCP-speaking hosts; runs the harness adapter at materialization time | Spawned as a stdio subprocess by the host (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), one per workspace |
| `podium sync` | Eager filesystem materialization; one-shot or watcher | Developer machines, CI runners, build pipelines |
| Language SDKs | Programmatic HTTP clients | Wherever your code runs — LangChain, Bedrock, OpenAI Assistants, custom orchestrators, eval harnesses |

The MCP server, `podium sync`, and the language SDKs share the same
registry HTTP API. They also share identity providers, the content
cache, layer composition, and the harness adapter. The MCP server
and `podium sync` are thin clients that delegate composition and
visibility to the registry, then run the adapter and write to disk
locally.

For filesystem-source deployments, only `podium sync` and the
filesystem-aware shared library are involved — no Postgres, no
object storage, no auth, no registry process.

## The three deployment shapes

You'll see these three labels everywhere in the docs. Pick the one
that fits today; graduate when you outgrow it.

### Filesystem

A directory of files; no daemon, no port, no auth. `podium sync`
reads the directory directly, applies layer composition and the
harness adapter, and writes to your harness's destination.

- **Who it's for.** Individual developers and small teams. Solo
  workflows keep the directory local; small teams commit it to git
  and every developer runs `podium sync` against their clone.
- **What you run.** Just the `podium` CLI.
- **What you get.** Eager materialization. The harness's own
  filesystem discovery does the loading at runtime.
- **What you don't get.** Lazy discovery (no MCP, no SDK). No
  centralized audit. No identity-based visibility filtering.
- **Multi-user.** The catalog is the git history; ingest is `git
  pull`. No shared-state coordination needed.

### Standalone server

A single binary running on one machine. SQLite + sqlite-vec +
filesystem object storage + a bundled embedding model, all
embedded. Bind to localhost or behind your VPN.

- **Who it's for.** Anyone of any team size who specifically wants
  runtime discovery (agents calling MCP meta-tools mid-session) or
  a single audit log without standing up the full standard stack.
  Most small teams don't need this; reach for it when filesystem
  mode stops fitting.
- **What you run.** `podium serve --standalone --layer-path
  /path/to/dir` plus the CLI.
- **What you get.** Runtime discovery via the MCP server. A single
  audit log capturing every load. Semantic search.
- **Migration path.** Point `podium serve --standalone` at the same
  directory your filesystem catalog uses; flip
  `defaults.registry` from a path to a URL. Authoring loop
  unchanged.

### Standard

The full deployment: Postgres + pgvector + S3 + OIDC + multi-tenancy.
Helm chart ships with the registry; supporting services are managed
or self-run alongside.

- **Who it's for.** Larger teams and organizations. Multi-tenant
  deployments, governed environments, anything with compliance
  constraints or identity-based visibility requirements.
- **What you run.** Registry replicas behind a load balancer,
  Postgres (managed or self-run), object storage, an OIDC IdP. See
  [Deployment → Operator guide](../deployment/operator-guide) and
  the spec's [§13](https://github.com/OWNER/podium/blob/main/spec/13-deployment.md).
- **What you get.** Per-layer visibility, freeze windows, signing,
  hash-chained audit, SCIM, SBOM/CVE pipeline, multi-tenancy.
- **Migration path.** `podium admin migrate-to-standard` exports
  from a standalone deployment to a standard one; the same artifact
  directory becomes a `local`-source layer until you cut over to
  Git-source layers.

## Where state lives

Three places. Each shape uses a different combination.

| State | Filesystem | Standalone | Standard |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Manifest metadata, layer config, audit | (none — directory is canonical) | SQLite (`~/.podium/standalone/podium.db`) | Postgres |
| Embeddings | (none) | sqlite-vec collocated in SQLite | pgvector collocated in Postgres (or external: Pinecone, Weaviate Cloud, Qdrant Cloud) |
| Bundled resource bytes | The directory itself | Filesystem (`~/.podium/standalone/objects/`) | S3-compatible object storage |
| Workspace local overlay | `<workspace>/.podium/overlay/` (highest precedence in the caller's effective view) |
| Content cache | `~/.podium/cache/` (content-addressed; shared across workspaces) |
| Sync state | `<target>/.podium/sync.lock` (per-target) |

The workspace overlay, content cache, and sync state are
client-side; they exist regardless of which deployment shape the
registry uses.

---

## Shared library code

Worth saying explicitly: the manifest parsers, glob resolver, layer
composer, `extends:` resolver, visibility evaluator, materialization
writer, and harness adapters all live in a single Go module. The
registry binary embeds it behind the HTTP API; `podium sync` in
filesystem mode calls the same module functions directly, skipping
HTTP. The MCP server and `podium sync` in server-source mode are
thin HTTP clients that invoke the same module's materialization
writer locally.

There is one canonical implementation per concern, not three. That's
why migrating between deployment shapes (filesystem → standalone →
standard) preserves behavior — same composer, same parsers, same
merge semantics, same harness adapter output. See [§2.2 of the
spec](https://github.com/OWNER/podium/blob/main/spec/02-architecture.md)
for the load-bearing rationale.

The language SDKs are the exception: they're independent HTTP
clients in Python and TypeScript, and they only work against an
HTTP server.

---

## Identity and trust

The registry attaches an OAuth-attested identity to every call.
Built-in identity providers:

- **`oauth-device-code`** — interactive device-code flow for
  developer hosts; tokens cached in the OS keychain.
- **`injected-session-token`** — runtime-issued signed JWT for
  managed agent runtimes (Bedrock Agents, OpenAI Assistants, custom
  orchestrators). The runtime registers its signing key once with
  the registry; the registry verifies signatures on every call.

Filesystem-source registries don't have identity by definition —
the visibility evaluator short-circuits to `true` for every layer.
Standalone deployments can run with or without auth; with auth,
they use the same OIDC machinery as standard deployments.

`tenant.expose_scope_preview` lets operators decide whether
aggregate visibility counts (artifact count, by-type, by-sensitivity)
are exposed to callers — useful for tenants where even those
aggregates would leak signal.

---

## Versioning

Versions are semver, author-chosen via the manifest's `version:`
field. Once `(artifact_id, version)` is ingested, it's bit-for-bit
immutable forever in the registry's content store. Subsequent
commits to the same version with different content are rejected at
ingest. References can pin exact versions
(`@1.2.3`), minor / patch ranges (`@1.2.x`, `@1.x`), or content
hashes (`@sha256:abc...`).

`load_artifact(id)` without a version pin resolves to the most
recently ingested non-deprecated version visible to the caller. For
session consistency, the meta-tools accept a `session_id` argument:
the first `latest` lookup within a session is recorded and reused
for every subsequent same-id lookup, so the host sees a consistent
snapshot.
